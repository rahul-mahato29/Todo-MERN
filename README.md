# Building a MERN Stack Todo Application with Zod

## 1. **Environment Setup**

- Install Node.js and npm on your machine.
- Set up a new React project using Vite: `npm create vite@latest`.
- Create a new Node.js project for the backend.

## 2. **Frontend Development (React)**

## 3. **Backend Development (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Zod)**

- Configure a Node.js and Express backend server.
- Integrate MongoDB for data storage.
- Implement Zod for backend data validation to ensure secure and valid inputs.
- Create API endpoints for handling todo operations like add, fetch, and delete.

## 4. **Zod Integration**

- Install Zod in your Node.js backend project using npm: `npm install zod`.
- Define schemas using Zod to validate incoming data.
- Integrate Zod validation within your API routes for robust data validation.

## 5. **Connect Frontend to Backend**

- Establish a connection between your React frontend and Node.js backend.
- Make API calls from the frontend to interact with the backend endpoints.

## 6. **Run the Application**

- Start both the React and Node.js servers.
- Open your to-do app in a browser and verify its functionality.
